    # Upload two artifacts:
    # - SteamRecordingIntegration contains the raw binaries. This artifact can
    #   be downloaded from the GH UI by users and moved straight to the mods
    #   folder of Celeste.
    # - release-artifact contains the ZIP file generated by msbuild.
    #
    # We need two artifacts because release-artifact is a zip of a zip. There is
    # no way to give a zip file to github without it re-compressing it,
    # frustratingly.
